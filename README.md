This was originally our college project, first developed using VB.NET a Desktop application. Now, Iâ€™m converting it into a web-based system using the MERN stack to further develop and improve my software development skills.

A web-based Barangay Management System for efficiently managing residents, officials, certificates, and blotter records. Built with React for the frontend and Node.js/Express for the backend, this project streamlines barangay administration with a modern, user-friendly interface.

## Modules and Functionalities

* **Login:** Secure user authentication with username/password and role-based access control (e.g., admin, staff).
* **Dashboard:** A central overview page with potential summary information or quick links to different modules.
* **Brgy Official:**
    * View a list of barangay officials with details (Full name, Gender, Age, Position, Term, Status).
    * Add, edit, and delete barangay official information.
    * Potentially manage profile pictures.
* **Resident:**
    * View, add, edit, and delete resident information (full name, address, birthdate, gender, contact number, etc.).
    * Search and filter residents.
* **Blotter:**
    * Record and manage barangay blotter incidents (date, complainant, respondent, narrative, status, actions taken, recorded by).
    * View, add, and update blotter records.
* **Certificate:**
    * Manage the issuance of various barangay certificates (e.g., residency, indigency).
    * Potentially create templates and generate certificates for specific residents.
    * Track issued certificates.
* **About:** A static page providing information about the system or the barangay.
* **Admin:** (Accessible to admin users)
    * Manage user accounts (add, edit, delete users and their roles).
* **Logout:** Securely log users out of the system.
